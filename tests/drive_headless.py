"""Smoke test for the standalone MCP server: no $AGENT99_NVIM, the bridge
starts its own headless Neovim through open_workspace and routes the LSP
and file tools to it. Runs on a scratch copy of tests/testproj because
headless edits are written to disk.

Run through tests/smoke.sh (which sets AGENT99_HEADLESS_INIT so the
instance uses the minimal config, not the user's).

The checks are grouped by the family of tools they cover, and a group is
what this file takes as an argument:

    python3 tests/drive_headless.py edit        # or tests/smoke.sh headless:edit

Groups share nothing - each runs in its own process, against its own copy
of the project, with its own headless Neovim - so one of them can be run
on its own while working on that family, and the whole suite runs several
at a time. AGENT99_TEST_JOBS caps how many; 1 runs them in order in this
process, which reads better when something fails.
