# Huyang implementation handoff

## Authority and invariant

- Branch: feature/huyang
- Reviewed base: 1c5302efe9ca51e1701e73df72d903f225fefe04
- Base ancestry check passed with git merge-base --is-ancestor.
- No install, deployment, installed-plugin update, live MCP restart, live
  configuration/state mutation, push, or pull request is authorized.

## Current checkpoint

- Completed stage: S18 — Impact graph, targeted tests and variants.
- Starting commit: `60e38abc1a310f954e6879f7c7c299999cf2a1e8`.
- Reconciliation fetched origin, confirmed a clean `feature/huyang` branch, confirmed reviewed
  base `1c5302efe9ca51e1701e73df72d903f225fefe04` in branch history, read the complete plan,
  frozen tool contract, handoff, and every predecessor/stage artifact named below, and verified
  S18 was exactly the first incomplete checklist stage.
- S18 exit gates are satisfied: bounded language-adapter dependency edges disclose provenance,
  confidence, completeness and caps; exact-revision test history drives advisory selection;
  selected/executed tests and reasons are explicit; build/configuration variants are reported;
  reflection, dynamic loading, generated/config files, graph caps, and omitted variants retain
  uncertainty; targeted success is independent from and never implies a full-gate pass.
- Only S18 is newly marked complete in the committed checklist.
- Exact next stage: S19 — First legacy wrapper families.

## S17 changes

- Added a durable, atomically persisted per-workspace diagnostic ledger with stable diagnostic
  and evidence IDs, cursored new/resolved notices, acknowledgement, and restart recovery.
- Added normalized push, pull, workspace and project-check evidence, whitespace normalization,
  same-provider push/pull deduplication, selected-provider enforcement, conflicting-provider
  retention, and incomplete-evidence-safe resolution.
- Added authoritative/corroborated/provisional/unavailable confidence and coverage, with
  version/result/progress/timeout barrier semantics and the weakest selected provider controlling
  a required dimension.
- Added exact/strong/likely/ambiguous/unattributed culprit ranking from sandbox, postimage,
  symbol and bounded impact-path facts; arrival timing alone never creates causality.
- Added structured Neovim `huyang_diagnostic_evidence`, including bounded attachment, recovered
  publish versions, pull payload/result IDs, producer identity/version and progress veto.
- Implemented modern `diagnostics`, `evidence_get`, common-envelope evidence IDs, and compact
  `diagnostic_updates` on later same-workspace replies.
- Wired prepared and explicit verification to the provider barrier. Configured repository checks
  remain separately identified corroborating fallback evidence.
- Modern direct edits and prepared plans no longer report `ok`/`READY` while semantic evidence is
  unavailable: they return `provisional`/`PROVISIONAL` with evidence and missing coverage.
- Added no S18 impact graph, affected-test selection, variants, legacy wrapper migration,
  debugger facade, deployment, installation, live configuration/state change, push, or pull request.

## S18 changes

- Added bounded revision-keyed impact graphs with Go, TypeScript/JavaScript, Python, and Lua
  dependency adapters, transitive reverse impact, adapter/confidence provenance, and file/edge caps.
- Added explicit risks for unresolved dependencies, reflection/dynamic loading, generated code,
  configuration/schema files, unreadable files, graph caps, untested affected nodes, and omitted
  required variants.
- Extended trusted project policy with named test suites, path associations, variants, required
  suites, named build/configuration variants, and impact caps.
- Added advisory affected-test selection from affected paths, colocated tests, required suites,
  variants, and prior revision-keyed failures. Selected and executed suites retain reasons.
- Persisted bounded atomic test history by workspace and exact revision, including scope, suite,
  variants, status, duration, and timestamp.
- Kept `affected_tests_passed` separate from `full_tests_passed`; targeted verification never
  sets `full_test_gate`.
- Added no S19 legacy-wrapper migration, S19D debugger facade, S20 release work, deployment,
  installation, live configuration/state mutation, push, or pull request.

## Verification

Run from /home/igor/Work/huyang on 2026-09-10:

- `go test -race ./internal/workspace ./internal/bridge -run 'Impact|Affected|Pipeline' -count=1`
  — exit 0; bounded graphs, uncertainty, variants, selection, revision history, verdict separation,
  and official MCP prepared-sandbox coverage passed.
- `make smoke` — exit 0; both binaries built and unit_edit, unit_testrun, unit_check, unit_index,
  MCP, headless, multi-workspace, and debug suites reported OK.
- `go test ./...` — exit 0; every Go package passed.
- `go vet ./...` — exit 0 with no output.
- `git diff --check` — exit 0 after implementation and before final handoff/checklist updates;
  repeated after final documents below.

## Decisions and risks

- Impact traversal is bounded and revision-keyed. Every dependency edge names the built-in language
  adapter and confidence; caps and unresolved imports make coverage incomplete.
- Affected-test selection is advisory. Configuration associations, colocated affected tests,
  required suites, selected variants, and prior failures are reasons, not a completeness proof.
- Test history is durable per workspace and exact revision, atomically replaced and bounded to the
  latest 1,000 entries.
- Targeted and full verdicts are structurally separate. `affected_tests_passed` never populates
  `full_test_gate`; only an explicit full run can report `full_tests_passed`.
- Static adapters intentionally disclose reflection/dynamic loading, generated files,
  configuration/schema effects, unresolved dependencies, graph caps, untested nodes, and omitted
  variants. These risks recommend a broader full gate.
- Built-in local import resolution is deliberately conservative. Alias-heavy package graphs,
  runtime loaders, generators, build systems, and configuration can require future adapter
  precision without weakening the current uncertainty disclosure.
- No deployment, installation, live-service/configuration mutation, installed-plugin update,
  push, or pull request occurred.
- Exact next stage: S19 — First legacy wrapper families.
