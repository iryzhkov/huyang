-- One truncation contract, shared by every tool that caps its reply.
--
-- Three numbers, and all three are computed after every filter has run:
-- `shown` is what the reply carries, `total` is what existed, and `dropped`
-- is the difference. A count taken from an already-truncated set is not one
-- of them. The counting pass has to reach past the point where the emitting
-- pass stopped, or the number it produces describes the cut rather than the
-- loss.
--
-- The rule this module exists to enforce: whenever `dropped > 0` the reply
-- says so, and says how many. A count that computes itself out of existence
-- suppresses the warning exactly where the loss is worst. skim answered a
-- 3000-deep JSON chain with 150 entries and no note at all, because its
-- count was of the not-yet-emitted siblings at the cut point and a chain has
-- none; the same count told a 5262-line document that 55 headings were
-- missing when 1161 were.
--
-- Two shapes, because replies have two shapes:
--
--   * `note()` for a truncation that lives inside a list of strings, where
--     the last entry has to carry the whole story.
--   * `fields()` for an object reply, which can hold `shown`, `total` and
--     `dropped` as numbers a caller can compute with.
--
-- A total that a bounded counting pass could not finish is a floor, and is
-- reported as one rather than as a number that looks exact.

local M = {}

-- Fields for an object-shaped reply. Returns nil when nothing was dropped,
-- so a caller can `vim.tbl_extend` the result in unconditionally.
--
-- opts.unit    what is being counted, for the note ("frames", "entries")
-- opts.reach   how to get the rest ("raise max=", "depth= shows them")
-- opts.floor   true when `total` is a lower bound, not the exact count

-- complete set; pass it explicitly when the emitting pass already stopped
-- short and something else counted the rest.

-- The same contract for one over-long string: a line, a name path, a hit.
--
-- A truncation inside a single string cannot carry three numbers, but it can
-- carry the two that matter - how much is shown and how much was cut - and it
-- must, because a clipped line that ends in nothing reads as a short line. A
-- 50,000-character minified line and an 11-character match on it were the same
-- reply until this existed: one grep hit, 30 KB.
--
-- Byte-counted, because that is what the reply budget is spent in, but never
-- cut through a UTF-8 sequence: a half rune is invalid JSON and the whole
-- reply is lost rather than the tail of one line.
