-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The verdict on an edit: when the servers have said all they will say.
--
-- A push-only server (lua_ls is one) does not republish when an edit left
-- its diagnostics as they were, so silence alone cannot be told apart from
-- "still analyzing", and every clean edit used to cost the whole wait_ms
-- ceiling. Three things resolve that:
--
--  * A barrier: one cheap request per server, sent with the change. A server
--    answers it only once it has taken the change in, so the reply is proof
--    the edit was seen, and settle_ms of silence after it means no
--    diagnostics are coming. The reply itself is discarded. (Asking
--    pull-capable servers for textDocument/diagnostic instead was tried and
--    dropped: pyright answers the pull and pushes as well, and every
--    diagnostic then appeared twice.)
--  * Learning: how long after the barrier reply a server's diagnostics
--    arrived is recorded per workspace and server, and the settle used for
--    that server follows the longest lag seen with a margin, once enough
--    publishes have been observed. Diagnostics that turn up after a report
--    went out count as a miss and raise it at once.
--  * Late delivery: whatever arrives after a report was sent is carried in
--    the next reply, so a wrong estimate delays attribution rather than
--    losing the diagnostic. With post_edit.wait off the whole report is
--    deferred that way and the edit tool returns as soon as the text is in.
--
-- The barrier alone turned out not to be enough, and the reason is worth
-- keeping: `textDocument/documentSymbol` is answered off the syntax tree,
-- which pyright and tsserver have ready in single-digit milliseconds, while
-- type checking runs on a separate queue and publishes later. So the ack
-- proves the server read the edit, not that it finished thinking about it,
-- and the settle that follows is silence measured before the analysis
-- started. Two things now sit above it:
--
--  * Version stamping (exact): publishDiagnostics carries the version of the
--    text it describes, and Neovim sends the buffer's changedtick as that
--    version. A publish stamped with the version we wrote is the server's own
--    statement that it analyzed this edit. Nothing is inferred from silence,
--    so no settle is waited out at all. Servers that omit the version fall
--    through to the heuristic, and the reply says which basis it had.
--  * Progress (a veto): a workDoneProgress token opened after the change is
--    the server saying outright that it is still working, whatever the clock
--    says. Tokens already open before the edit are somebody else's work.
--
-- Two more ideas, not implemented, in the order they are worth trying if the
-- two above prove insufficient:
--
--  * A semantic barrier for servers that do not stamp versions: pull
--    diagnostics (`textDocument/diagnostic`, LSP 3.17) cannot be answered
--    without analyzing, which is exactly the property documentSymbol lacks.
--    It was tried once and dropped because pyright answers the pull and
--    pushes as well and every diagnostic appeared twice - but that is a
--    deduplication problem, and the fix is to discard the pull's payload and
--    use it purely as the barrier, the way the documentSymbol reply is
--    discarded today. `semanticTokens/full` needs binding information too.
--  * Cross-file: version stamping speaks for the edited buffer only. A move
--    that leaves a stale import in a third file needs that file re-analyzed,
--    which servers do lazily and may not do at all until asked. move_symbols
--    loads those files (ctx.also); a pull diagnostic per file would be the
--    semantic barrier for them, and would have caught the black probe's
--    trans.py breakage at reply time instead of 230 ms later.
