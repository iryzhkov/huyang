-- The files an edit can break through the file it edited: worked out,
-- loaded and asked before the verdict is taken.
--
-- A language server publishes diagnostics for the documents it has been told
-- about, and it is told about a document when something opens it. An edit
-- that changes a symbol's shape breaks the files that use that symbol, and
-- when nothing has opened those files nothing ever asks about them. A Go
-- return type changed from int to string broke four packages and the reply
-- read "no new errors or warnings"; the warmer the server, the cleaner that
-- false verdict looked, because a warm server had already answered for the
-- edited file and had nothing more to say about it. Java behaves the same
-- way. Python and TypeScript pass the same fixture, because pyright and
-- tsserver re-check the importers of an open file on their own - which is
-- exactly why this cannot be left to the server.
--
-- What is computed here is a closure over textDocument/references, two hops
-- deep: the files that use what the edited file declares, and the files that
-- use what those files declare. The second hop is what reaches a file whose
-- error never names the edited symbol at all - `usera.Val` changed type
-- because `core.Compute` did, and `userd` fails on `usera.Val`.
--
-- Where the closure cannot be computed - no server, no references support,
-- nothing indexed to ask about - that is said in the reply. A verdict whose
-- scope is unknown is stated, not guessed.
