// Routing: which Neovim a tool call is sent to, and which project root its
// relative paths resolve against.
//
// The standalone server can hold several headless workspaces open at once
// (see headless.go). They never overlap, so a path belongs to at most one of
// them and most calls route themselves: the workspace that owns the file
// named in the arguments is the one that gets the call - owns it as the
// caller wrote it, not as it resolves, so a symlink cannot carry the call
// into a workspace nobody named. Calls that name no path - check_project,
// undo_edit, the debugger tools - fall back to an explicit "workspace"
// argument, then to the workspace last used for that kind of work, then to
// the active one. With several open, a path no workspace holds is refused
// rather than guessed at.
