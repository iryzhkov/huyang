// Workspace lifecycle: what happens to a headless Neovim between the call
// that opened it and the one that closes it.
//
// Four things live here, and they are one design rather than four fixes.
//
// A workspace can go away without anybody closing it - the Neovim crashes, or
// the OOM killer takes it, or the idle sweep below collects it. Until now that
// turned the next call into "no Neovim to talk to: call open_workspace first",
// an error the agent has to notice, understand and recover from in the middle
// of doing something else. reviveFor starts the instance again instead, so a
// workspace dying underneath the server costs a pause.
//
// That is what makes an idle timeout safe to have. A workspace is a Neovim
// with a full set of language servers behind it - measured on this machine, a
// lua-language-server is 175-450 MB and a session holding two workspaces was
// 923 MB - and it stays up for the whole session even when nothing has touched
// it for hours. Collecting an idle one gives that memory back, and because the
// next call reopens it, the agent sees a slow call rather than a failure.
//
// The same reasoning covers the workspace that was never opened at all.
// autoOpenFor takes the root a call already names - the file in its
// arguments, or the project around the working directory - and opens it,
// because "call open_workspace first" is a round trip spent restating what
// the arguments said.
//
// Finally, an instance that is killed outright cannot remove its own socket,
// so the runtime directory collects dead entries. Every socket carries the pid
// of the bridge that made it, which is enough to tell on startup which ones
// belong to nobody.
