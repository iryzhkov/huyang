package bridge

// Headless workspaces for the standalone MCP server. When the bridge is not
// launched from inside Neovim (no $AGENT99_NVIM), a client such as Claude
// Code first calls open_workspace(root): the bridge spawns
// `nvim --headless --listen <socket>` in that root with the user's normal
// configuration, so the same LSP servers attach as in an interactive
// session. Several roots can be open at once, and each tool call is routed
// to the instance that owns the path it names (see routing.go). An instance
// is killed when its workspace is closed or the server exits.
//
// Open workspaces never overlap: a root that contains, or is contained by,
// an open one is refused. Two instances over one file tree would each hold
// their own buffers for the same files, and an edit made in one would be
// lost the moment the other wrote.
