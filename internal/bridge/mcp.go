// MCP stdio server exposing the tools. Speaks newline-delimited JSON-RPC on
// stdin/stdout. Two modes:
//
//   - embedded: $AGENT99_NVIM is set (the plugin spawned `claude -p` against
//     this server). Only the LSP tools are served; claude brings its own file
//     tools and the editor's buffers are the source of truth.
//   - standalone: no $AGENT99_NVIM (e.g. registered with `claude mcp add`).
//     Serves open_workspace/close_workspace, which run a headless Neovim in a
//     project root, plus the file tools (annotated grep, skim-on-large-read,
//     list_files). LSP tools error until a workspace is open, unless the
//     server inherited $NVIM from an enclosing :terminal.
