package bridge

// Which client a call belongs to.
//
// One agent99-bridge serves every agent that talks to it, and several of the
// records it keeps are per client rather than per project: the undo ledger,
// the check_project and run_tests baselines, and the set of diagnostics a
// client has already been shown. Keyed by root alone they leaked between
// clients - one agent's undo_edit() reverted another agent's edit and
// reported success, and a client that had never recorded a baseline was
// told how many lines were "new since the baseline" another client
// recorded. Every request now carries a client id, and the editor keys
// those records by (root, client).
//
// What the transport can actually tell us, measured against Claude Code
// 2.1.267 with a logging MCP server:
//
//   - one MCP connection is one server process, so a second Claude Code
//     session, a second T3 thread and an editor-embedded bridge are each a
//     different client, and are separated by this;
//   - the subagents of one session share that one connection. Their
//     tools/call requests carry _meta.claudecode/toolUseId, which is unique
//     per call, and progressToken, a per-connection counter - nothing that
//     groups one agent's calls together. The bridge cannot tell such agents
//     apart on its own. A harness that wants them separated sends
//     _meta["agent99/client"], which is honoured per request, or gives each
//     agent its own server process with AGENT99_CLIENT_ID set.
//
// Nothing here guesses. Where the id cannot tell two agents apart they
// share one ledger, as they did before, and the replies say whose entries
// they are rather than claiming an isolation that is not there.
